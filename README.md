### Crash Data -  Chicago
##### Timeframe: 2015-2021

##### Sample Questions/Types of Graphs
* What impacts crash type the most?
	* Crash type vs lighting
	* Bar graph for first crash type
	* Frequency of crashes at specific time of day

* What type of injuries are caused by what types of crashes?
	* Cost of damage and type of injury
	* Speed vs fatality count
	* Direction (NSEW) facing wrecks, more common than others

* What types of wrecks occur based off location?
	* Road condition vs type of road vs weather
	* Hit and run vs location (lat nad lng), over time
	* Time between when crash occurred and when police showed up. (compared to police stations near by)

* Scatterplot outliers for lane count


#### Injuries Section - Jon

###### Do car crashes tend to yield more serious injuries as the cost of damage increases?

1st Plot: Cost of Damage group vs. Injuries Total (pie chart)

-- The cost of damage shows that the majority of injuries fall within the damage group of over $1500, at 57.6%, and the $500-1500 group taking up 29.4% of injuries. With that being said, only 13% of total injuries due to car wrecks ended up having a damage cost of less than $500.

2nd Plot: Cost of Damage vs. # of Fatal Injuries

-- Based on the graph, there is a clear positive correlation between cost of damage and fatal injury count. As the as cost of damage increased, the # of fatal injuries increased as well.

3rd Plot: Speed Limit vs. # of Fatal Injuries

-- A huge majority of fatal injuries proved to be in areas where the posted speed limit was 30mph. This could largely be due to the fact that people were speeding in residential areas which are prone to having more parked cars, dips, lights, stop signs, etc. as compared to areas with faster speed limits like freeways.
